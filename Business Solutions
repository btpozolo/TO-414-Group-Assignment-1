#Problem 1: stations to increase capacity
```{r}
#Reorangize data by factors 
trainingdata$start.station.name <- as.factor(trainingdata$start.station.name)

trainingdata$end.station.name<- as.factor(trainingdata$end.station.name)

#Sort by stations and months, inflow is the numbers of bikes return, outflow is the numbers of bikes borrow. 

trip.by.month.inflow <- count(trainingdata, end.station.name, stoptime = cut(stoptime, breaks = "month"))
 
trip.by.month.outflow <- count(trainingdata, start.station.name, starttime = cut(starttime, breaks = "month")) 

#Merge the inflow and outflow to show deficit 

trip.by.month <- merge(trip.by.month.inflow, trip.by.month.outflow, by = c(1,2))

trip.by.month$deficit <- trip.by.month$n.x - trip.by.month$n.y

#Draw graphs to show the top three stations with deficits and surplus by months 

trip.by.month$month <- month(trip.by.month$stoptime)
```

##Bike Maintenance
###By Number of Trips

To check on if certain bikes are being used more than others, we first looked into the number of unique trips taken by each bike. 
If the bikes are being used roughly the same amount of times, we would expect the histogram of number of uses to be roughly normal.

```{r}
#TODO make sure the t data is full data set

#Grouping by bikeID
by.id <- t %>%
  group_by(bikeid) %>%
  summarise(total.duration = sum(tripduration)/60, num.uses = n())

#Plot of NumTrips  by bikeID
qplot(num.uses, data=by.id, geom="histogram", main = "Total Number of Trips per Bike", xlab = "Total Number of Trips (per bike)", ylab = "Amount of Bikes") +
   scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + 
   scale_x_continuous(labels = comma)
```
The above histogram shows that the data shows more of a bimodal distribution, which could indicate that there is some other factors causing certian bikes to be used more frequently than others. 

###By Trip Duration
Next we looked at the total trip durations of each bike to see if any patterns emerged. We however think that frequency of use (as shown above) would be more indicative of difference in usage patterns than the trip durations. 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#Smaller sample of 100 for histogram (replace with by id)
# sample <- sample_n(by.id, 100)

#Mean and Medain pretty similar for number of uses
# summary(by.id$num.uses)
# hist(sample$num.uses, 100, col="black", main = "Histogram of Sample Number of Uses", xlab = "Number of Uses (per unique bike)")


qplot(total.duration, data=by.id, geom="histogram", bins = 500, main = "Total Trip Time per Bike", xlab = "Total Trip Time (in minutes)", ylab = "Amount of Bikes") +
   scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + 
   scale_x_continuous(labels = comma)

#QQ plot to show non-normal distribution
qqnorm(by.id$total.duration); qqline(by.id$total.duration, col = 2) 
```
These graphs show that the trip time duration per unique bike does not follow a normal distribution, however a nonlinear distribution is more appropriate. Also, you can note from the above graphs that is appears that the trip time is skewed right as should be expected with outlier longer rides. 

###Total Trip Time and Number of Trips

To show the relationship between number of trips taken and the total trip time by each bike, we created the following scatterplot. This graph helps show why the total trip time would not be a normal distribution as well as helping to see how frequent most bikes are used and how long they are used for.
```{r}
#To show the correlation between number of trips and total distance
p <- ggplot(by.id, aes(by.id$num.uses, by.id$total.duration))
p + geom_point(alpha = 1/20) +ggtitle("Total Trip Duration by Number of Trips")+
  xlab("Number of Trips Taken")+
  ylab("Aggregate Trip Duration (min)")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma)
```
